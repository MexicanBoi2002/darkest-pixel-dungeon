1 moonstone just turn situation to night, currently may only in coordination with a enhanced potion of mindvision, but the night 

i) this might be a little technical, i dont have an idea if we should put this there. 
terrains such as Wal, Closed Door, blocks the hero's sight, the field of view is calculated refer to the hero's see distance, and whether a tile is transparent or not, this is the common way. in Darkest PD, a little difference is the light, 
for example, hero has a see distance of 8, view distance 4, then a tile(if not blocked by those walls) with distance less than 4 would be see, but suppose this tile is far at 6, which is out of view distance, but in the see distance, then, if this tile is lighted, the hero could see it.
this is why i explain see distance as the maximum distance the hero could see, while the view distance as the distance the hero could see without light
and, whether a tile is lighted depends all the luminaries in the dungeon, the candle on the wall, the torch in your hand, and the glowworm. so, your torch also lights the path for the enemies.

ii) the purify process takes turns to finish, during the process, the other functions of the flask is disabled, like the rune in dew vial would ban the heal action

"help me", "yes", "no", "leave"
    1: "i need food", "give", "no", "leave"
    2: "oh...", "leave"
