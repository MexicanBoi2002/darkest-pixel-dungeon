Darkest Pixel Dungeon version 0.4.0

Hello, egoal again. Didnt expect to be so soon, but the translation for 0.4.0 is done. **Great thanks to all translation contributors!**

In case, here is the [link to last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/dava7v/darkest_pixel_dungeon_version_040_prerelease/).

As the changes scene is not translated, I put some most important updates info here:

- **PERKS**: More than 30 perks added in to the adventure, each perk gives hero a new ability. Start from level 2, hero now get a random perk(choose from 3) every 4 level. The cost is, *decrease one SoU in each chapter*. (2 for each chapter now).

- Hero: New skill *Soul Siphon* added to Urn of Shadow. Perk "Recover more HP from dew" now hold by Sorceress, instead of Huntress. 

- Magical damage now ignore physical defense (eg: normal armor), most hero starts with 15% magical resistance. Elemental resistance rebalanced.

- New enemy Ashes Skull. Mobs no longer close the door behind. Some new items, and many property adjustment on items and mobs.

Happy Dungeoneering! Hope you guys enjoy it.

Darkest Pixel Dungeon version 0.4.0 prerelease!

Hello, egoal here. This time I bring the *prelease* of version 0.4.0.

This is a major update, with *prelease* I mean: the English localization is still missing. But, I'm uploading the resources to transifex. It will take some days before the formal release. If you are interested, you could [**help on translation**](https://www.transifex.com/darkest-pixel-dungeon-localization/)

I would make another post by the formal release, I think by then I would give a brief list of updates, you know, the update list in the game is not translated. By now, I only describe the key new features here:

**PERKS**: More than 30 perks added in to the adventure, each perk gives hero a new ability. Start from level 2, hero now get a random perk(choose from 3) every 4 level. The cost is, decrease one SoU in each chapter. (2 for each chapter now).

This feature bring much differences to the dungeon. Many mobs, weapons were adjusted.

Happy Dungeoneering! Hope you guys enjoy it.
